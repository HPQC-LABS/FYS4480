===== Hartree-Fock algorithm =====

Our Hartree-Fock matrix  is
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha | \hat{h}_0 | \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock equations are solved in an iterative waym starting with a guess for the coefficients $C_{j\gamma}=\delta_{j,\gamma}$ and solving the equations by diagonalization till the new single-particle energies
$\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}$ do not change anymore by a prefixed quantity. 




Normally we assume that the single-particle basis $|\beta\rangle$ forms an eigenbasis for the operator
$\hat{h}_0$, meaning that the Hartree-Fock matrix becomes  
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta}\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
can be written out in a more compact form as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{HF}\hat{C}=\epsilon^{\mathrm{HF}}\hat{C}. 
\]
!et




The Hartree-Fock equations are, in their simplest form, solved in an iterative way, starting with a guess for the
coefficients $C_{i\alpha}$. We label the coefficients as $C_{i\alpha}^{(n)}$, where the subscript $n$ stands for iteration $n$.
To set up the algorithm we can proceed as follows:

 * We start with a guess $C_{i\alpha}^{(0)}=\delta_{i,\alpha}$. Alternatively, we could have used random starting values as long as the vectors are normalized. Another possibility is to give states below the Fermi level a larger weight.
 * The Hartree-Fock matrix simplifies then to (assuming that the coefficients $C_{i\alpha} $  are real)
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j = 1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C_{j\gamma}^{(0)}C_{j\delta}^{(0)}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et




Solving the Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem yields then new eigenvectors $C_{i\alpha}^{(1)}$ and eigenvalues
$\epsilon_i^{HF(1)}$. 
 * With the new eigenvalues we can set up a new Hartree-Fock potential 
!bt
\[
\sum_{j = 1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C_{j\gamma}^{(1)}C_{j\delta}^{(1)}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The diagonalization with the new Hartree-Fock potential yields new eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
This process is continued till for example
!bt
\[
\frac{\sum_{p} |\epsilon_i^{(n)}-\epsilon_i^{(n-1)}|}{m} \le \lambda,  
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a user prefixed quantity ($\lambda \sim 10^{-8}$ or smaller) and $p$ runs over all calculated single-particle
energies and $m$ is the number of single-particle states.




===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program  =====


The Hartree-Fock algorithm can be broken down as follows. We recall that  our Hartree-Fock matrix  is 
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha \vert\hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
Normally we assume that the single-particle basis $\vert\beta\rangle$
forms an eigenbasis for the operator $\hat{h}_0$, meaning that the
Hartree-Fock matrix becomes
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta}\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
can be written out in a more compact form as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{HF}\hat{C}=\epsilon^{\mathrm{HF}}\hat{C}. 
\]
!et


The equations are often rewritten in terms of a so-called density matrix,
which is defined as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gamma\delta}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\langle\gamma|i\rangle\langle i|\delta\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{i\gamma}C^*_{i\delta}.
\end{equation}
!et
It means that we can rewrite the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{\gamma\delta} \rho_{\gamma\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
It is convenient to use the density matrix since we can precalculate in every iteration the product of two eigenvector components $C$. 


Note that $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0\vert\beta \rangle$ denotes the
matrix elements of the one-body part of the starting hamiltonian. For
systems like self-bound nuclei $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0\vert\beta \rangle$ is the
kinetic energy, whereas for neutron drops, $\langle \alpha \vert \hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle$ represents the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian since
the system is confined in a harmonic trap. If we are working in a
harmonic oscillator basis with the same $\omega$ as the trapping
potential, then $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle$ is
diagonal.

An example of a function written in python which performs the
Hartree-Fock calculation is shown here.  In setting up your code you
will need to write a function which sets up the single-particle basis,
the matrix elements $t_{\alpha\gamma}$ of the one-body operator
(called $h0$ in the function below) and the antisymmetrized TBMEs
and the density matrix
elements $\rho_{\beta\delta}$ (called *densityMatrix* below).




Here we display the Hartree-Fock part only, assuming that single-particle data and two-body matrix elements have already been read in.

===== Hartree-Fock in second quantization and stability of HF solution =====

We wish now to derive the Hartree-Fock equations using our second-quantized formalism and study the stability of the equations. 
Our ansatz for the ground state of the system is approximated as (this is our representation of a Slater determinant in second quantization)
!bt
\[   
|\Phi_0\rangle = |c\rangle = a^{\dagger}_i a^{\dagger}_j \dots a^{\dagger}_l|0\rangle.
\]
!et
We wish to determine $\hat{u}^{HF}$ so that 
$E_0^{HF}= \langle c|\hat{H}| c\rangle$ becomes a local minimum. 

In our analysis here we will need Thouless' theorem, which states that
an arbitrary Slater determinant $|c'\rangle$ which is not orthogonal to a determinant
$| c\rangle ={\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}}
a_{\alpha_{i}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle$, can be written as
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle=exp\left\{\sum_{a>F}\sum_{i\le F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| c\rangle 
\]
!et





Let us give a simple proof of Thouless' theorem. The theorem states that we can make a linear combination av particle-hole excitations  with respect to a given reference state $\vert c\rangle$. With this linear combination, we can make a new Slater determinant $\vert c'\rangle $ which is not orthogonal to 
$\vert c\rangle$, that is
!bt
\[
\langle c|c'\rangle \ne 0.
\] 
!et
To show this we need some intermediate steps. The exponential product of two operators  $\exp{\hat{A}}\times\exp{\hat{B}}$ is equal to $\exp{(\hat{A}+\hat{B})}$ only if the two operators commute, that is
!bt
\[
[\hat{A},\hat{B}] = 0.
\]
!et 






===== Thouless' theorem =====


If the operators do not commute, we need to resort to the "Baker-Campbell-Hauersdorf":"http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Campbell%E2%80%93Hausdorff_formula". This relation states that
!bt
\[
\exp{\hat{C}}=\exp{\hat{A}}\exp{\hat{B}},
\]
!et
with 
!bt
\[
\hat{C}=\hat{A}+\hat{B}+\frac{1}{2}[\hat{A},\hat{B}]+\frac{1}{12}[[\hat{A},\hat{B}],\hat{B}]-\frac{1}{12}[[\hat{A},\hat{B}],\hat{A}]+\dots
\]
!et
From these relations, we note that 
in our expression  for $|c'\rangle$ we have commutators of the type
!bt
\[
[a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i},a_{b}^{\dagger}a_{j}],
\]
!et
and it is easy to convince oneself that these commutators, or higher powers thereof, are all zero. This means that we can write out our new representation of a Slater determinant as
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle=exp\left\{\sum_{a>F}\sum_{i\le F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| c\rangle=\prod_{i}\left\{1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}+\left(\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right)^2+\dots\right\}| c\rangle
\]
!et




We note that
!bt
\[
\prod_{i}\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\sum_{b>F}C_{bi}a_{b}^{\dagger}a_{i}| c\rangle =0,
\]
!et
and all higher-order powers of these combinations of creation and annihilation operators disappear 
due to the fact that $(a_i)^n| c\rangle =0$ when $n > 1$. This allows us to rewrite the expression for $|c'\rangle $ as
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle=\prod_{i}\left\{1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| c\rangle,
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as 
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle=\prod_{i}\left\{1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| a^{\dagger}_{i_1} a^{\dagger}_{i_2} \dots a^{\dagger}_{i_n}|0\rangle.
\]
!et
The last equation can be written as
!bt
\begin{align}
|c'\rangle&=\prod_{i}\left\{1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| a^{\dagger}_{i_1} a^{\dagger}_{i_2} \dots a^{\dagger}_{i_n}|0\rangle=\left(1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai_1}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i_1}\right)a^{\dagger}_{i_1} \\
& \times\left(1+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai_2}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i_2}\right)a^{\dagger}_{i_2} \dots |0\rangle=\prod_{i}\left(a^{\dagger}_{i}+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle.
\end{align}
!et



===== New operators =====


If we define a new creation operator 
!bt
\begin{equation}
b^{\dagger}_{i}=a^{\dagger}_{i}+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}, label{eq:newb}
\end{equation}
!et
we have 
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle=\prod_{i}b^{\dagger}_{i}|0\rangle=\prod_{i}\left(a^{\dagger}_{i}+\sum_{a>F}C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et
meaning that the new representation of the Slater determinant in second quantization, $|c'\rangle$, looks like our previous ones. However, this representation is not general enough since we have a restriction on the sum over single-particle states in Eq.~(ref{eq:newb}). The single-particle states have all to be above the Fermi level.
The question then is whether we can construct a general representation of a Slater determinant with a creation operator 
!bt
\[
\tilde{b}^{\dagger}_{i}=\sum_{p}f_{ip}a_{p}^{\dagger},
\]
!et
where $f_{ip}$ is a matrix element of a unitary matrix which transforms our creation and annihilation operators
$a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ to $\tilde{b}^{\dagger}$ and $\tilde{b}$. These new operators define a new representation of a Slater determinant as
!bt
\[
|\tilde{c}\rangle=\prod_{i}\tilde{b}^{\dagger}_{i}|0\rangle.
\]
!et




===== Showing that $|\tilde{c}\rangle= |c'\rangle$  =====



We need to show that $|\tilde{c}\rangle= |c'\rangle$. We need also to assume that the new state
is not orthogonal to $|c\rangle$, that is $\langle c| \tilde{c}\rangle \ne 0$. From this it follows that 
!bt
\[
\langle c| \tilde{c}\rangle=\langle 0| a_{i_n}\dots a_{i_1}\left(\sum_{p=i_1}^{i_n}f_{i_1p}a_{p}^{\dagger} \right)\left(\sum_{q=i_1}^{i_n}f_{i_2q}a_{q}^{\dagger} \right)\dots \left(\sum_{t=i_1}^{i_n}f_{i_nt}a_{t}^{\dagger} \right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et  
which is nothing but the determinant $det(f_{ip})$ which we can, using the intermediate normalization condition, 
normalize to one, that is
!bt
\[
det(f_{ip})=1,
\]
!et  
meaning that $f$ has an inverse defined as (since we are dealing with orthogonal, and in our case unitary as well, transformations)
!bt
\[
\sum_{k} f_{ik}f^{-1}_{kj} = \delta_{ij},
\]
!et  
and 
!bt
\[
\sum_{j} f^{-1}_{ij}f_{jk} = \delta_{ik}.
\]
!et  




Using these relations we can then define the linear combination of creation (and annihilation as well) 
operators as
!bt
\[
\sum_{i}f^{-1}_{ki}\tilde{b}^{\dagger}_{i}=\sum_{i}f^{-1}_{ki}\sum_{p=i_1}^{\infty}f_{ip}a_{p}^{\dagger}=a_{k}^{\dagger}+\sum_{i}\sum_{p=i_{n+1}}^{\infty}f^{-1}_{ki}f_{ip}a_{p}^{\dagger}.
\]
!et
Defining 
!bt
\[
c_{kp}=\sum_{i \le F}f^{-1}_{ki}f_{ip},
\]
!et
we can redefine 
!bt
\[
a_{k}^{\dagger}+\sum_{i}\sum_{p=i_{n+1}}^{\infty}f^{-1}_{ki}f_{ip}a_{p}^{\dagger}=a_{k}^{\dagger}+\sum_{p=i_{n+1}}^{\infty}c_{kp}a_{p}^{\dagger}=b_k^{\dagger},
\]
!et
our starting point. We have shown that our general representation of a Slater determinant 
!bt
\[
|\tilde{c}\rangle=\prod_{i}\tilde{b}^{\dagger}_{i}|0\rangle=|c'\rangle=\prod_{i}b^{\dagger}_{i}|0\rangle,
\]
!et
with 
!bt
\[
b_k^{\dagger}=a_{k}^{\dagger}+\sum_{p=i_{n+1}}^{\infty}c_{kp}a_{p}^{\dagger}.
\]
!et




This means that we can actually write an ansatz for the ground state of the system as a linear combination of
terms which contain the ansatz itself $|c\rangle$ with  an admixture from an infinity of one-particle-one-hole states. The latter has important consequences when we wish to interpret the Hartree-Fock equations and their stability. We can rewrite the new representation as 
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle = |c\rangle+|\delta c\rangle,
\]
!et
where $|\delta c\rangle$ can now be interpreted as a small variation. If we approximate this term with 
contributions from one-particle-one-hole (*1p-1h*) states only, we arrive at 
!bt
\[
|c'\rangle = \left(1+\sum_{ai}\delta C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_i\right)|c\rangle.
\]
!et
In our derivation of the Hartree-Fock equations we have shown that 
!bt
\[
\langle \delta c| \hat{H} | c\rangle =0,
\]
!et
which means that we have to satisfy
!bt
\[
\langle c|\sum_{ai}\delta C_{ai}\left\{a_{a}^{\dagger}a_i\right\} \hat{H} | c\rangle =0.
\]
!et
With this as a background, we are now ready to study the stability of the Hartree-Fock equations.



===== Hartree-Fock in second quantization and stability of HF solution =====

The variational condition for deriving the Hartree-Fock equations guarantees only that the expectation value $\langle c | \hat{H} | c \rangle$ has an extreme value, not necessarily a minimum. To figure out whether the extreme value we have found  is a minimum, we can use second quantization to analyze our results and find a criterion 
for the above expectation value to a local minimum. We will use Thouless' theorem and show that
!bt
\[
\frac{\langle c' |\hat{H} | c'\rangle}{\langle c' |c'\rangle} \ge \langle c |\hat{H} | c\rangle= E_0,
\]
!et
with
!bt 
\[
 {|c'\rangle} = {|c\rangle + |\delta c\rangle}.
\]
!et
Using Thouless' theorem we can write out $|c'\rangle$ as
!bt
\begin{align}
 {|c'\rangle}&=\exp\left\{\sum_{a > F}\sum_{i \le F}\delta C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}\right\}| c\rangle\\ 
&=\left\{1+\sum_{a > F}\sum_{i \le F}\delta C_{ai}a_{a}^{\dagger}
a_{i}+\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{ab > F}\sum_{ij \le F}\delta C_{ai}\delta C_{bj}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}a_{b}^{\dagger}a_{j}+\dots\right\}
\end{align}
!et
where the amplitudes $\delta C$ are small.


The norm of $|c'\rangle$ is given by (using the intermediate normalization condition $\langle c' |c\rangle=1$) 
!bt
\[
\langle c' | c'\rangle = 1+\sum_{a>F}
\sum_{i\le F}|\delta C_{ai}|^2+O(\delta C_{ai}^3).
\]
!et
The expectation value for the energy is now given by (using the Hartree-Fock condition)
!bt
\[
\langle c' |\hat{H} | c'\rangle=\langle c |\hat{H} | c\rangle +
\sum_{ab>F}
\sum_{ij\le F}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}\langle c |a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{a}\hat{H}a_{b}^{\dagger}a_{j}|c\rangle+
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{ab>F}
\sum_{ij\le F}\delta C_{ai}\delta C_{bj}\langle c |\hat{H}a_{a}^{\dagger}a_{i}a_{b}^{\dagger}a_{j}|c\rangle+\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{ab>F}
\sum_{ij\le F}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}^*\langle c|a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{b}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{a}\hat{H}|c\rangle
+\dots
\] 
!et





We have already calculated the second term on the right-hand side of the previous equation
!bt
\begin{align}
\langle c | \left(\{a^\dagger_i a_a\} \hat{H} \{a^\dagger_b a_j\} \right) | c\rangle&=\sum_{pq} \sum_{ijab}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj} \langle p|\hat{h}_0 |q\rangle 
            \langle c | \left(\{a^{\dagger}_i a_a\}\{a^{\dagger}_pa_q\} 
             \{a^{\dagger}_b a_j\} \right)| c\rangle\\
& +\frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \sum_{ijab}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj} \langle pq| \hat{v}|rs\rangle 
            \langle c | \left(\{a^\dagger_i a_a\}\{a^{\dagger}_p a^{\dagger}_q a_s  a_r\} \{a^{\dagger}_b a_j\} \right)| c\rangle ,
\end{align}
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[
E_0\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2+\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2(\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_i)-\sum_{ijab} \langle aj|\hat{v}| bi\rangle \delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}.
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2!}\langle c |\left(\{a^\dagger_j a_b\} \{a^\dagger_i a_a\} \hat{V}_N  \right) | c\rangle  = 
\frac{1}{2!}\langle c |\left( \hat{V}_N \{a^\dagger_a a_i\} \{a^\dagger_b a_j\} \right)^{\dagger} | c\rangle 
\]
!et
which is nothing but
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2!}\langle c |  \left( \hat{V}_N \{a^\dagger_a a_i\} \{a^\dagger_b a_j\} \right) | c\rangle^*
=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijab} (\langle ij|\hat{v}|ab\rangle)^*\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}^*
\]
!et
or 
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijab} (\langle ab|\hat{v}|ij\rangle)\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}^*
\]
!et
where we have used the relation
!bt
\[ 
\langle a |\hat{A} | b\rangle =  (\langle b |\hat{A}^{\dagger} | a\rangle)^*
\]
!et
due to the hermiticity of $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{V}$.


We define two matrix elements
!bt
\[
A_{ai,bj}=-\langle aj|\hat{v} bi\rangle
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
B_{ai,bj}=\langle ab|\hat{v}|ij\rangle
\]
!et
both being anti-symmetrized.



With these definitions we write out the energy as
!bt
\begin{align}
\langle c'|H|c'\rangle& = \left(1+\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2\right)\langle c |H|c\rangle+\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2(\varepsilon_a^{HF}-\varepsilon_i^{HF})+\sum_{ijab}A_{ai,bj}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}+\\
&\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijab} B_{ai,bj}^*\delta C_{ai}\delta C_{bj}+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijab} B_{ai,bj}\delta C_{ai}^*\delta C_{bj}^*
+O(\delta C_{ai}^3),
\end{align}
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\[
\langle c'|H|c'\rangle = \left(1+\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2\right)\langle c |H|c\rangle+\Delta E+O(\delta C_{ai}^3),
\]
!et
and skipping higher-order terms we arrived
!bt
\[
\frac{\langle c' |\hat{H} | c'\rangle}{\langle c' |c'\rangle} =E_0+\frac{\Delta E}{\left(1+\sum_{ai}|\delta C_{ai}|^2\right)}.
\]
!et



We have defined 
!bt
\[
\Delta E = \frac{1}{2} \langle \chi | \hat{M}| \chi \rangle
\]
!et
with the vectors 
!bt
\[ 
\chi = \left[ \delta C\hspace{0.2cm} \delta C^*\right]^T
\]
!et
and the matrix 
!bt
\[
\hat{M}=\left(\begin{array}{cc} \Delta + A & B \\ B^* & \Delta + A^*\end{array}\right),
\]
!et
with $\Delta_{ai,bj} = (\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_i)\delta_{ab}\delta_{ij}$.



The condition
!bt
\[
\Delta E = \frac{1}{2} \langle \chi | \hat{M}| \chi \rangle \ge 0
\]
!et
for an arbitrary  vector 
!bt
\[ 
\chi = \left[ \delta C\hspace{0.2cm} \delta C^*\right]^T
\]
!et
means that all eigenvalues of the matrix have to be larger than or equal zero. 
A necessary (but no sufficient) condition is that the matrix elements (for all $ai$ )
!bt
\[
(\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_i)\delta_{ab}\delta_{ij}+A_{ai,bj} \ge 0.
\]
!et
This equation can be used as a first test of the stability of the Hartree-Fock equation.
