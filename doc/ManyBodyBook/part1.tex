\part{Basic concepts}
The first part of this text aims at giving an introduction to many-body theory. We introduce the basic notations pertinent to creation and annihilation operators, Wick's theorem and the computation of expectation values of quantum mechanical operators. 
After having introduced these basic concepts, we present the first two many-body methods, Hartree-Fock theory and density functional theory.
