# Quantum Mechanics for Many-Particle systems

This course gives an introduction to the quantum mechanics of
many-body systems and the methods relevant for many-body
problems in such diverse areas as atomic, molecular, solid-state and
nuclear physics, chemistry and materials science. A theoretical
understanding of the behavior of quantum-mechanical many-body systems, that is, systems containing many interacting particles - is a
considerable challenge in that, normally, no exact solution can be found.
Instead, reliable methods are needed for approximate but accurate
simulations of such systems.

The aim of this course is to present some of the most widely used
many-body methods, starting with the underlying formalism of second
quantization. The topics
covered include second quantization with creation and annivilation operators, Wick's theorem, Feynman diagram rules, microscopic mean-field theories
(Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham theories), many-body perturbation theory,
large-scale diagonalization methods, coupled cluster theory,
algorithms from quantum computing, and
Green's function approaches. Both fermionic and bosonic systems are
discussed, depending on the interests of the participants.
Selected physical systems from various fields such as quantum
chemistry, solid-state physics and nuclear physics are studied,
depending on the background and interests of the participants.

## Practicalities

1. Four lectures per week, Fall semester, 10 ECTS. The lectures will be recorded and linked to this site and the official University of Oslo website for the course;
2. Two hours of exercise sessions for work on projects and exercises for each group;
3. Three projects which are graded and count 1/3 each of the final grade;
4. A selected number of weekly assignments;
5. The course is offered as a so-called _cloned_ course,  FYS4480 at the Master of Science level and FYS9480 as a PhD course;
6. Weekly email with summary of activities will be mailed to all participants;
